## Overview

The `phantom_persist_rs` repository contains a Rust implementation of the phantom persistence technique. This technique is detailed in the article available at [Phantom Persistence Blog](https://blog.phantomsec.tools/phantom-persistence). The repository aims to provide developers and security researchers with tools and methods to understand and apply phantom persistence in their own projects.

## What is Phantom Persistence?

Phantom persistence is a technique used in cybersecurity, particularly in malware development. It allows attackers to maintain a presence on a compromised system even after reboots or updates. This is achieved by hiding malicious components in legitimate processes or using various evasion techniques.

Understanding phantom persistence is crucial for cybersecurity professionals and developers working on security tools. By studying this technique, one can learn how to detect and mitigate its effects, improving overall system security.

## Getting Started

To get started with `phantom_persist_rs`, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety and performance. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.56 or later
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

## Installation

To install the `phantom_persist_rs` package, clone the repository and build it using Cargo. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damilaredebo/phantom_persist_rs.git
cd phantom_persist_rs
cargo build --release
```

After building the project, you can find the executable in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

To use the `phantom_persist_rs` implementation, execute the built binary. You can run it with various command-line options to customize its behavior. Here‚Äôs a basic command to run the tool:

```bash
./target/release/phantom_persist_rs [options]
```

Refer to the help command to see available options:

```bash
./target/release/phantom_persist_rs --help
```

## Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to implement phantom persistence using the tools provided in this repository.

1. **Setup the Environment**: Ensure you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.
2. **Run the Tool**: Use the command below to execute the phantom persistence technique:

```bash
./target/release/phantom_persist_rs --example
```

3. **Analyze the Output**: The tool will generate logs that you can analyze to understand how the technique works.

This example provides a basic understanding of how to use the tool. For more complex implementations, refer to the source code and documentation provided in the repository.
